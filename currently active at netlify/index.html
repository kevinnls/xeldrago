<p> Hi this is a website designed by xeldrago for simple intro purpose!!</p>
<p> NEW!! blog contents below </p>
<p>LIFE LESSONS & TRUTH BOMBS</p>
<ul>
  <li>-There's things tht need time to take decision 
And then there is tht shouldn't need tht time(use 5 second rule)</li>
  <li>-Average life expectancy maybe 79.6years but the actual living is 17.5 years (sleep,eating,drinking,old age,non-consciousness)
<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CLZW2SSB4H-/?igshid=1w5siweuly3pb">(for reference)</a></li>
  <li>-Don't think too much.. u feel and experience what u think.. so stop.. breathe 
Relax... 
Don't pressure urself.. no one's dying bud(got your 17 years yet)</li>
  <li>-perspective, the main way or one of the major ways to prepare tht point of view is by analogy ..(think of an example that suits the situation best)<a href="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTZh9GFMkLu8u-34_qCshRFEFJ9i3m5O-m20g&usqp=CAU">perspective</a></li>
  <li>1. Awkward but isn't it true that whatvr we may eat ,how rich nor how poor,how tasty, how miserable it all comes down the same way as every food ever for a human in the next day morning ðŸ™„(no matter how good things go(start),they all end up bad(death eventually))
2. Bad habits ,people who say they oly do a little of it ... (Shit is shit no matter how little or big it is...sry)
3.Girls are vulnerable ,boys misuse ..no two ways about it (*FACTS*)
4. (once you know this you won't be normal)Dopamine, testosterone, oxytocin, norepinephrine, and phenylethylamine all work together to create a feedback loop of love</li>
  <li>-dont listen to unknown quotes ,it is just new trend not the real fact in the end !<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CLszSZlnHjb/?igshid=sutx119d8rk0">for reference</a></li>
  <li>-nothing is ever tooooo dumb for life 
Cos we literally just pay to see other human beings (movies,airplane tickets,through specs,heck even prostitution)</li>
  <li>-How to Move Forward in a One-sided Relationship
If you feel that you're in an imbalanced relationship, Campbell suggests documenting your time and making a concrete list of observations. </li>
  <li>If after making these observations, you feel that things are one-sided, you need to communicate your feelings with your partner who otherwise won't know that a problem exists.and if it still pertains cut ties with the partner </li>
  <li>However, initiating change can be the hardest part of navigating a one-sided relationship. "The problem with one-sided relationships is that often it is just one partner initiating these 'talks' because being in what we call an over-benefitted situation (getting more out of a relationship than you are putting in) can be quite comfortable," Campbell explains. "So your partner may not respond favorably to the complaint."</li>
  <li>In fact, "researchers call this pattern 'demand-withdrawal,' which involves one partner is initiating a discussion or requesting a change and the other withdrawing from the conversation and avoiding discussion," she elaborates.1ï»¿ It's a very unhealthy and a common pattern in one-sided relationships. "If the over-benefitted cares about the other's well-being, they will seek to improve the balance and take on more of the work or put in more effort," says Campbell.</li>
  <li>"If a partner does not change after being made aware of the imbalance, the partnership might not be a good fit and the under-benefitted person should consider moving on," she adds.</li>
  <li>SEE TRUTH 
If u like somone ,ull exaggerate them in ur mind 
If u dislike someone ,ull still exaggerate them in ur mind 
If u exaggerate ,it means ur unable to see them as they are ,
U can never handle life the way it should be ..
</li>
  <li>BELIEF 
Now...I have to be grateful to somone for the good things that happend and would happen to me in future 
Thus I believe in Jesus and am grateful to him 
So that I don't feel guilty under my own judgement and conscience </li>
  <li>SELF WORTH 
ur body isn't urs 
It's prolly ur parents' (if u don't believe in God)
Or it's ur creator's(ur God)
So if u wana die for your friends sake and ur tht pure of it ...
Then u might as well take ur body and soul as ur other friend who deserves ur attention too..
Don't treat it like u own it and it's u.. it ain't u if u don't look after it like u should ..
It isn't selfish.. it's taking care of tht body and soul given to u.. just like a friend</li>
</ul>
