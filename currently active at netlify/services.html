<h2>Digital or Online Marketting</h2>

content marketing, search platforms, social media, and more.<br>
</p>

<h2>Counselling services</h2>
<p>
A counsellor is not there to sit you down and tell you what to do.<br>
Instead, they will encourage you to talk about what's bothering you in order to uncover any root causes and<br>
identify your specific ways of thinking. The counsellor may then look to create a plan of action <br>

to either help you reconcile your issues, or help you to find ways of coping.
<h2>Website & Business Account developement</h2>
<p>
Web development is the building and maintenance of websites;
 it's the work that happens behind the scenes to make a website look great,
 work fast and perform well with a seamless user experience. Web developers, or 'devs', 
do this by using a variety of coding languages
